            <br />
            <p>Here at Theana Productions, we value our players. This is why we decided that we wouldn't collect (and even less sell) any of our player's data unless necessary.</p>
            <p>As of today, none of our games needs our users to enter any of their personal informations, and we will keep it that way as long as we can.</p>

            <br />
            <p>Some of our PlayStore games now have Unity Ads integrated in them. To know more about the datas they collect and their privacy policy, check this <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy">link</a>.</p>
            <br />
            <p>If you wish to voice any complaint, or if you have any questions, you can contact us <a href="index.html" class="inside-link">here</a>.</p>
